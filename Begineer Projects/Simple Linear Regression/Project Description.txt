                                    SALARY ANALYSIS
It's a very simple mini project in which the data has two columns- years of experience
and salary. The aim is create a suitable model for it so as to determine correlation between
the two data columns and predict the salary based on years of experience. It's done by dividing
the data set into training set and test set. The machine is trained using Linear Regression model
and the prediction is visualized using 'matplotlib' library.

Steps followed :
1. Data preprocession
2. Creating Linear Regression Model and training it.
3. Visualizing the 2 dimentional graph.

LANGUAGE USED : PYTHON 3.6

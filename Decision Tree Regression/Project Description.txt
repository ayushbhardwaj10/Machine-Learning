                                    SALARY ANALYSIS
It's a very simple mini project in which the data has three columns- Position,Level and salary.
The aim is create a suitable model for it so as to determine correlation between
the three data columns and predict the salary based upon Position and level. It's done by dividing
the data set into training set and test set. The machine is trained using Decision Tree Regression model
and the prediction is visualized using 'matplotlib' library.

Steps followed :
1. Data preprocession
2. Creating Decision Tree Regression Model and training it.
3. Visualizing the 2 dimentional graph.

LANGUAGE USED : PYTHON 3.6

                                    Profit ANALYSIS
It's roject in which the data has 5 columns- R&D spend,Administration,Marketing,State and profit.
The aim is create a suitable model for it so as to determine correlation between
the data columns and predict the Profit based upon other variables. It's done by dividing
the data set into training set and test set. The machine is trained using Multiple Regression model. 
A method called 'Backward Elimnation' is used to find the optimal indipendent variables which plays 
crucial role in making the right predictions.

Steps followed :
1. Data preprocession
2. Creating Multiple Regression Model.
3. Using Backward Elimination method to get optimal variables
3. Predicting
